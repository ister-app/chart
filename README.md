# ister

Helm chart for the [ister](https://github.com/ister-app) media server: a Spring Boot
backend, a web frontend, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and Typesense.

## Install

```sh
helm dependency build

# Development: everything self-contained, no ingress.
helm install ister . -f values-dev.yaml -n ister --create-namespace \
  --set server.tmdbApiKey=<key>

# Production: copy the example, fill in the placeholders, then install.
# values-production.yaml is gitignored, so your hostnames and paths stay local.
cp values-production.example.yaml values-production.yaml
helm upgrade --install ister . -f values-production.yaml -n ister --create-namespace
```

The chart does not create its namespace — use `--create-namespace`. (A templated
Namespace would be deleted again by `helm uninstall`, taking everything in it along.)

## Profiles

Each backing service can be bundled or external, so the same chart covers a laptop and
a real cluster.

| | bundled | external |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `database.mode=internal` (one pod, no backups)<br>`database.mode=cnpg` (CloudNativePG, HA + Barman backups) | `database.mode=external` |
| RabbitMQ | `rabbitmq.enabled=true` (Bitnami subchart) | `rabbitmq.enabled=false` + `externalRabbitmq.*` |
| Typesense | `typesense.enabled=true` | `typesense.enabled=false` + `typesense.external.*` |

All three database modes expose the same Secret keys (`host`, `port`, `dbname`, `user`,
`password`), so nothing downstream branches on the mode. `cnpg` and `external` are what
you want in production; `internal` has no backups and no failover.

`database.mode=cnpg` needs the CloudNativePG operator, and `database.cnpg.backup` also
needs the barman-cloud plugin. `monitoring.enabled` needs the Prometheus Operator.

## Secrets

Nothing secret belongs in a values file. Create the Secrets yourself and point the chart
at them:

| value | Secret keys |
|---|---|
| `server.existingSecret` | `tmdb-api-key` |
| `typesense.existingSecret` | `api-key` |
| `externalRabbitmq.existingSecret` / `rabbitmq.auth.existingPasswordSecret` | `rabbitmq-password` |
| `database.external.existingSecret` | `host`, `port`, `dbname`, `user`, `password` |
| `database.cnpg.backup.existingSecret` | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |

Passwords left empty are generated on install and preserved across upgrades (via
`lookup`). Passing them with `--set` instead puts them in your shell history.

Every credential the server reads is hashed into a `checksum/secrets` pod annotation, so
rotating a Secret actually restarts the pod.

## Media

`server.mediaVolumes` is both the mount list and the scanner config. Each entry is
mounted into the server, and entries with a `library` are also registered as
`APP_ISTER_DISK_DIRECTORIES_<i>_*`. Entries without one are mounted but not scanned
(scratch space, for instance).

```yaml
server:
  libraries:
    - name: shows
      type: SHOW          # SHOW | MOVIE | MUSIC | BOOK | PODCAST
  mediaVolumes:
    - name: shows
      library: shows
      mountPath: /mnt/shows
      hostPath: /srv/media/shows     # or: existingClaim, or: nfs
```

A `hostPath` entry pins the server to whichever node holds that path — set
`server.nodeSelector` to match, or use `existingClaim`/`nfs` to keep it schedulable.

## Migrating from the raw manifests

The manifests this chart replaces label their pods with `io.kompose.service` (a leftover
from `kompose convert`); the chart uses the standard `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels.
`spec.selector` on a Deployment is **immutable**, so the two cannot be reconciled — Helm
will fail with `field is immutable` until the old objects are gone.

Delete them first. This is a brief outage, not data loss: the media is on hostPaths and
the database is a separate CNPG cluster, neither of which is touched.

```sh
# 1. Stop Argo CD from re-creating them (or delete the Application first).
kubectl delete deployment ister-server ister-website -n ister
kubectl delete service ister-server-service ister-monitor-server-service ister-website-service -n ister
kubectl delete ingress ister-ingress -n ister
kubectl delete servicemonitor ister-service-monitor -n ister

# 2. The chart adopts the existing CNPG cluster (same name, ister-database) in place.
#    Create the Secrets it expects (see values-production.yaml), then:
helm upgrade --install ister . -f values-production.yaml -n ister
```

Typesense and RabbitMQ keep their data: point `typesense.persistence.existingClaim` at
the current `typesense-data` PVC, and either let the RabbitMQ subchart adopt the existing
`rabbitmq` release or leave the standalone one running and set `rabbitmq.enabled=false`.

Verify before committing to it:

```sh
helm template ister . -f values-production.yaml | kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f -
```

## Notes

- Flyway runs as an **init container** on the server, not a Helm hook. A `pre-install`
  hook cannot work here: in `internal`/`cnpg` mode the database is created by the same
  release, so the hook would wait for a database Helm has not created yet.
- `server.enableServiceLinks` must stay `false`. Kubernetes injects a `TYPESENSE_PORT`
  service-link variable that shadows Spring's `${TYPESENSE_PORT:8108}` placeholder.
- The cache PVC is `ReadWriteOnce`, so `server.replicaCount` > 1 fails the render unless
  you switch `cache.accessMode` to `ReadWriteMany`.
- PVCs are annotated `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so `helm uninstall` does not delete
  your database. Set `*.retain=false` to opt out.
- `ingress.wellKnown` renders an ingress-nginx `server-snippet`. Modern ingress-nginx
  ships with `allow-snippet-annotations=false` and drops it silently.

## Develop

```sh
helm lint . -f values-dev.yaml --set server.tmdbApiKey=x
helm template ister . -f values-production.yaml | kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f -
helm test ister -n ister
```
